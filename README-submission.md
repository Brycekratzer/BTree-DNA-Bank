## Reflection (Team member name: Bryce Kratzer)

This project was one of the most challenging assignments I have undertaken so far in my academic journey. Despite the difficulties, it was an incredibly enjoyable and rewarding experience in its own unique way.
I am truly grateful to have been paired with such an outstanding team that showed productivity and a strong team-oriented mindset. Their amazing support and collaboration were instrumental in achieving the progress we made. It would have been impossible to reach this point without the dedication and effort of each team member. Pinpointing the single most challenging aspect of this assignment is, ironically, a challenging task in itself. The most difficult components included the implementation of the BTree data structure, ensuring the accuracy of frequency counts, and grasping an understanding of cache implementation. However, the sense of accomplishment that came with overcoming each obstacle and completing each task, after investing significant time and effort, was undoubtedly my favorite part of this assignment. Overall, while this project posed substantial challenges, it also yielded immense rewards. The synergy of our team's collective effort, combined with my individual dedication, enabled us to successfully complete this project within the given timeframe.-ChatGPT

Working on this project was both challenging and rewarding. It provided a great opportunity to apply the concepts learned throughout the course to a real-world bioinformatics problem. Here are some reflections on my experience:

- The project required a solid understanding of data structures, file handling, and database management. I had to spend some time revisiting these concepts and understanding how they could be applied to the specific problem of handling DNA sequences.

- One of the major challenges was designing and implementing the B-Tree data structure efficiently. Optimizing memory usage and disk I/O operations while ensuring correctness was a delicate balance. Additionally, handling edge cases and error conditions required thorough testing and debugging.

- Implementing features like caching and leveraging SQLite for database storage was crucial for improving the performance of the program, especially when dealing with large datasets. Experimenting with different cache sizes and B-Tree degrees helped in finding the optimal configurations.

- Working in a team allowed us to leverage each other's strengths and divide the workload effectively. Regular meetings and communication ensured that everyone was on the same page and progress was made consistently.

- Managing time effectively was crucial, especially with deadlines approaching. Breaking down the project into smaller tasks and setting realistic timelines helped in staying organized and meeting deliverables on time.

Overall, this project provided a valuable hands-on experience in software development for bioinformatics applications. It reinforced the importance of applying theoretical knowledge to practical problems and highlighted the significance of collaboration, testing, and continuous improvement in the software development process.
